	<p class="first"><b>GeneraPassword</b> is an <b>free</b> application to create strong passwords starting from simple keys easy to remember.<br />
	Thanks to a script <b>encryption Javascript</b> and an HTML form, you can generate alphanumeric passwords (with or without special characters), alphabetic or numeric, the length we wish.</p>
	<p>To create your secret code (PIN), just enter a key pair in the fields <span><b>Secret Key</b></span> and <span><b>Password</b></span>, choose the type of password you want to get (i.e. alphanumeric, alphabetic, numeric only, alphanumeric with special characters), specify its length and move to the last field <span><b>Code</b></span>.</p>
	<p>The system will automatically generate a masked password, resulting from the previously entered parameters, which can be shown using the appropriate command [<span id="show"> Show </span>], or it can be copied "in the background" with normal functions of the device such as : Select, Copy and Paste, directly where needed.</p>
	<blockquote><b>Note:</b> The code generated (PIN) is neither sent nor saved anywhere and will be deleted once you close the page or the application.</blockquote>
	<p>The advantage of this system is that we are able to adopt a rule set itself to generate a password, <b>complex</b> and not associated to any possible word, which if necessary can be obtained simply by utilizing the rule described above.</p>
	<p>For example, we can set as <span><b>Secret Key</b></span> the name of the site or service on which we want to use the password (<span>i.e. "Bank" or "Gmail" or "Twitter"</span>) and enter as <span><b>Password</b></span> a word easy to remember (<span>or even the old and <i>"usual"</i> password</span>). Then all you need is to set the length and type of code to be generated and the result will be obtained.<br />
	To <b>regenerate</b> the secret code, will be enough to remember the name of service and the old password.</p>
	<blockquote><b>Tip:</b> To create a different secret code (PIN) every month, you can set in the rules to insert in the keys the number of the month so that automatically a different password can be generated.</blockquote>
	<p>You just have to try!<br />
	Define your rule and create <b>efficient</b> passwords.</p>
